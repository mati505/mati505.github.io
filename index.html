    <h3>Hi! In this webpage, I will try to explain (to the best of my abilities), how webpages work!</h3>
    <h3>I made this webpage full of practical examples; if you want to see how a piece of code works in action, just press the "Try it!" button!</h3>
    <h3>You can also see the webpage code in the footer of this webpage: you can test it out by yourself!</h3>
    <h3>Hope you have fun learing how webpages work!</h3>

    <h1 class="heading">The 3 Basic Web Languages</h1>
    <h3>Webpages need to do a lot of stuff at once, and it can get confusing (very) when you need to manage everything in one code document.</h3>
    <h3>That's why programmers made 3 different main Web languages, each managing a separate part of the webpage. Every webpage builds upon these.</h3>
    <h3>In this section, I will explain a little bit about each one of them, and what order to learn them in:</h3>
    <h2 class="subheading">HTML: Web Backbone</h2>
    <h3>HTML is short for Hyper Text Markup Language, a fancy description for "what the webpage actually contains". It doesn't have any fancy styling, but all of the webpages content is made in HTML </h3>
    <button class="nextbtn" id="toHTML">Interested? Jump to HTML ðŸ§±</button>
    <h2 class="subheading">CSS: The Look Lounge</h2>
    <h3>You can say anything you want about HTML, but it definetly isn't pretty. Without CSS, our creations would still be bland, greyish, and not interesting paragraphs.</h3>
    <button class="nextbtn" id="toCSS">Seems fun? Hop on over to CSS ðŸŽ¨</button>
    <h2 class="subheading">Javascript: The Action Arena</h2>
    <h3>Who cares if you have nice styles and content? Without Javascript, everything would be so boooring. Could you even survive a day without annoying cat popups?</h3>
    <button class="nextbtn" id="toJS">Want more action? Whoosh over to JS! âš¡</button>
